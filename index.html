        a = Good<br />
        b = Neutral<br />
        c = Misguided<br /><br />

        <h3 style="text-align:center;">SO, WHY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE?</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
            <li>Well, there are many reasons. Ultimately though, no human can accurately assess why a particular event happened. Only God can.</li>
            <li>“Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity. All that I know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know everything completely, just as God now knows me completely.” (Corinthians 13:12)<li>
        <br/>
            <li>Romans tells us tells us that it's not even about being "glorious" or sin-free; it's about faith. So while the above quiz is full of satire, the real take-home is to honor God and be faithful.<li>
            <li>"But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. <b>There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.</b> God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished— he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus." (Romans 3:21-26)</li>
                <br/>
            <li>To go off of that, Romans includes another great passage. Specifically, where the author says “I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.”. This is a great point that our real focus should not be on the "bad" in the present, but rather the blessing that follows.  </li>
            <li>"I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. 19 For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. 20 For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope 21 that[h] the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God."(Romans 8:18-21)</li><br/>
            <li>Following the previous passage in Romans, it says that God works all things for the good of those who love him. This doesnt say that bad things won't happen to them. As mentioned above, we cannot see the full picture. This is God making a promise to faithful individuals that he will make bad things ultimately good; HOWEVER, he doesn't say that bad things will not happen.</li>
            <li>"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified."(Romans 8:28-30)</li><br/>

                    <li> “Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone. (LUKE 18:19)</li>
                    <li>Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.  (JAMES 1:17)</li>
                    <li>My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.  (JAMES 1:19-20)</li>
                    <li>Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. (PHILIPPIANS 2:3-4 )</li>
                    <li>You also must be patient. Keep your hopes high, for the day of the Lord’s coming is near. (JAMES 5:8)</li>
